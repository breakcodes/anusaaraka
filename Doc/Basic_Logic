When the ids are grouped , then they should not pass  to wsd rules since individual ids did'nt have  meaning.

  grouped ids     - TAM  
  individual ids  - tam

  vibakthi_id.dat file contains the above 2 info.
  for wsd purpose we are giving same variable TAM (for both Tam & tam)

Removing to_0 grouping in lwg.  since to.clp and to_0_tam.clp have almost same rules.
this should be handled in wsd rules.
