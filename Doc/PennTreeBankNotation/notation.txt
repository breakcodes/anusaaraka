notation <list:notation>

In the present corpus, each bracket is labeled for at least 1 
syntactic category but may have as many as 4 function tags. function tags
 In previous Treebank releases, only standard syntactic labels 
(e.g. NP, ADVP, PP, etc.) syntactic labels were used to label 
constituents; every bracket had just one label. The limitations 
of this system become apparent when a word or phrase that belongs 
to one syntactic category is used for some other function or when 
it plays a role that is not easily identified without special 
annotation.

In addition to the function tags, we have also augmented our 
annotation with the coindexation of null elements and several 
varieties of “pseudo-attach”.

1.1 Bracket labels

bracket labels

1.1.1 Clause level

See  for a fuller explanation of the use(s) of each of these 
labels.



 .2 ex plus .1 ex minus .1 ex 

  S --- Simple declarative clause, i.e. one that is not 
  introduced by a (possibly empty) subordinating conjunction or 
  -word and that does not exhibit subject-verb inversion. 

  SBAR --- Clause introduced by a (possibly empty) subordinating 
  conjunction. 

  SBARQ --- Direct question introduced by a -word or -phrase. See 
  . Indirect questions and relative clauses should be bracketed 
  as SBAR, not SBARQ. 

  SINV --- Inverted declarative sentence, i.e. one in which the 
  subject follows the tensed verb or modal. 

  SQ --- Inverted yes/no question, or main clause of a -question, 
  following the -phrase in SBARQ. S SBAR SBARQ SINV SQ 

1.1.2 Phrase level

bracket labels

 .2 ex plus .1 ex minus .1 ex 

  ADJP --- Adjective Phrase. Phrasal category headed by an 
  adjective (including comparative and superlative adjectives). 
  Example: outrageously expensive. ADJP 

  ADVP --- Adverb Phrase. Phrasal category headed by an adverb 
  (including comparative and superlative adverbs). Examples: 
  rather timidly, very well indeed, rapidly. ADVP 

  CONJP --- Conjunction Phrase. Used to mark certain “multi-word” 
  conjunctions, such as as well as, instead of. CONJP 

  FRAG --- Fragment. (see ) FRAG 

  INTJ --- Interjection. Corresponds approximately to the 
  part-of-speech tag UH (see ). INTJ 

  LST --- List marker. Includes surrounding punctuation. (see ) LST
   

  NAC --- Not A Constituent; used to show the scope of certain 
  prenominal modifiers within a noun phrase. NAC 

  NP --- Noun Phrase. Phrasal category that includes all 
  constituents that depend on a head noun. NP 

  NX --- Used within certain complex noun phrases to mark the 
  head of the noun phrase. Corresponds very roughly to N-bar 
  level but used quite differently. NX 

  PP --- Prepositional Phrase. Phrasal category headed by a 
  preposition. PP 

  PRN --- Parenthetical. (See section [list:notation:PRN] below 
  for a complete description.) PRN 

  PRT --- Particle. Category for words that should be tagged RP, 
  as described in , with some guidance from  sections 16.3-16 in 
  tricky ADVP vs. PRT decisions (but note that the Treebank 
  notion of particle is somewhat different from that of Quirk et 
  al.). PRT 

  QP --- Quantifier Phrase (i.e., complex measure/amount phrase); 
  used within NP. (see ) QP 

  RRC --- Reduced Relative Clause. (see ) RRC 

  UCP --- Unlike Coordinated Phrase. UCP 

  VP --- Verb Phrase. Phrasal category headed a verb. VP 

  WHADJP --- Wh-adjective Phrase. Adjectival phrase containing a 
  -adverb, as in how hot. WHADJP 

  WHADVP --- Wh-adverb Phrase. Introduces a clause with an ADVP 
  gap. May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, 
  containing a -adverb such as how or why. WHADVP 

  WHNP --- Wh-noun Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. 
  May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, 
  containing some -word, e.g. who, which book, whose daughter, 
  none of which, or how many leopards. WHNP 

  WHPP --- Wh-prepositional Phrase. Prepositional phrase 
  containing a -noun phrase (such as of which or by whose 
  authority) that either introduces a PP gap or is contained by a 
  WHNP. WHPP 

  X --- Unknown, uncertain, or unbracketable. X is often used for 
  bracketing typos and in bracketing the...the-constructions (see 
   and ). X 

1.2 Function tags

function tags

1.2.1 Form/function discrepancies

form/function discrepancies

  -ADV (adverbial) ADV@-ADV --- marks a constituent other than 
  ADVP or PP when it is used adverbially (e.g., NPs or free (“
  headless”) relatives). However, constituents that themselves 
  are modifying an ADVP generally do not get -ADV.

   (ADJP (NP-ADV a little bit) angry)

  

   (S (NP-SBJ You) (VP can (VP leave (SBAR-ADV if (S (NP-SBJ-8 
  you) (ADVP really) (VP want (S (NP-SBJ *-8) (VP to (VP 
  go)))))))))

  

  If there is a more specific adverbial tag available (i.e. one 
  of the tags listed in section [list:function-tags:adverbials] 
  below), the more specific tag is assumed to imply -ADV and is 
  used alone. Thus in the following example, the -TMP tag on 
  yesterday implies -ADV.

   (S (NP-SBJ He) (VP left (NP-TMP yesterday))) 

  NOT:

   (NP-ADV-TMP yesterday) 

  Nouns such as today, which often behave adverbially, are 
  labeled NP when they appear in argument position.

  

   (S (NP-SBJ Today) (VP is (NP-PRD (NP the first day) (PP of (NP 
  (NP the rest) (PP of (NP your life)))))))

  

  -NOM (nominal) --- marks free (“headless”) relatives and 
  gerunds when they act nominally. (See  for more information 
  about free relatives, and  for more information about gerunds.) 
  NOM@-NOM

   (S (SBAR-NOM-SBJ (WHNP-10 What) (S (NP-SBJ I) (ADVP really) 
  (VP like (NP *T*-10)))) (VP is (NP-PRD chocolate)))

  

   (S (S-NOM-SBJ (NP-SBJ *) (VP Baking (NP pies))) (VP is 
  (ADJP-PRD fun)))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ I) (VP do not (VP mind (PP about (S-NOM (NP-SBJ 
  your) (VP leaving (ADVP-TMP early)))))))

   

  Note that other non-NP constituents are not tagged -NOM when 
  they appear in argument positions (e.g., infinitivals, PPs), 
  though they do get -SBJ when they occur in subject position.

   (S (S-SBJ (NP-SBJ *) (VP To (VP have (VP refused)))) (VP would 
  (VP have (VP been (NP-PRD political suicide)))))

  

   (S (PP-SBJ (PP From (NP proud pool-owners)) (PP to (NP 
  perpetual hosts and handymen))) (VP was (NP-PRD a short step)))

  

1.2.2 Grammatical role

  -DTV (dative) --- marks the dative object in the unshifted form 
  of the double object construction. DTV@-DTV dative PPs <list:notation:grammatical-role:DTV>

  If the preposition introducing the “dative” object is for, it 
  is considered benefactive (see -BNF on page [list:notation:grammatical-role:BNF]
  ).

  

   (S (NP-SBJ I) (VP asked (NP a question) (PP-DTV of (NP the 
  president))))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ Aristotle) (VP gave (NP the book) (PP-DTV to (NP 
  Plato))))

  

  Compare with the shifted dative shift

   (S (NP-SBJ Aristotle) (VP gave (NP Plato) (NP the book)))

  

  Other verbs have semantically similar complements that could be 
  considered “dative” objects. However, -DTV (or -BNF) is only 
  used after verbs that can undergo dative shift. Other putative 
  datives are annotated with -CLR.

   (S (NP-SBJ He) (VP donated (NP money) (PP-CLR to (NP the 
  museum))))

  

  -LGS (logical subject) --- is used to mark the logical subject 
  in passives. It attaches to the NP object of by and not to the 
  PP node itself. LGS@-LGS subject!logical

   (S (NP-SBJ-7 That) (VP was (VP painted (NP *-7) (PP by (NP-LGS 
  Mark)))))

  

  -PRD (predicate) --- marks any predicate that is not VP. PRD@-PRD
   predicate!function tag for

   (S (NP-SBJ I) (VP consider (S (NP-SBJ Kris) (NP-PRD a fool))))

  

   (SQ Was (NP-SBJ he) (ADVP-TMP ever) (ADJP-PRD successful) ?)

  

  In do so constructions, the so is annotated as a predicate. so@{ so} as in { do so

   (S (NP-SBJ They) (ADVP also) (VP did (ADVP-PRD so)))

  

   (SINV and (ADVP-PRD-TPC-1 so) (VP did (ADVP-PRD *T*-1)) 
  (NP-SBJ the hippopotamuses))

  

  -PUT --- marks the locative complement of put. PUT@-PUT <list:notation:grammatical-role:PUT>

   (S (NP-SBJ John) (VP put (NP the book) (PP-PUT on (NP the 
  table))))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ John) (VP put (NP the book) (ADVP-PUT there)))

  

  It does not go on just any complement or child of put:

   (S (NP-SBJ They) (VP put (NP the baby) (PRT down)))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ She) (VP put (NP it) (ADVP-MNR bluntly)))

  

  

  -SBJ (surface subject) --- marks the structural surface subject 
  of both matrix and embedded clauses, including those with null 
  subjects. SBJ@-SBJ subject!surface

  -TPC (“topicalized”) --- marks elements that appear before the 
  subject in a declarative sentence, but in two cases only: TPC@-TPC
   fronted constituents

  (i) if the fronted element is associated with a *T* in the 
  position of the gap.

  (ii) if the fronted element is left-dislocated (i.e., it is 
  associated with a resumptive pronoun in the position of the 
  gap). (See the section on fronted elements in  for more details 
  on the treatment of fronted elements and the section on *T* 
  with fronted elements in  for more details on the distribution 
  of *T*.) left-dislocation

  

   (S (PP-TPC-12 Of (NP (NP the 500 barbers) (PP-LOC in (NP 
  Philadelphia)))) , (NP-SBJ (NP (QP only 10)) (PP *T*-12)) (VP 
  know (SBAR (WHNP-13 what) (S (NP-SBJ they) (VP are (VP doing 
  (NP *T*-13)))))))

  

  -VOC (vocative) --- marks nouns of address, regardless of their 
  position in the sentence. It is not coindexed to the subject 
  and does not get -TPC when it is sentence-initial. VOC@-VOC

   (SQ (NP-VOC Mike) , would (NP-SBJ you) (INTJ please) (VP close 
  (NP the door)) ?)

   

1.2.3 Adverbials

adverbials <list:function-tags:adverbials>

Adverbials are generally VP adjuncts.

  -BNF (benefactive) --- marks the beneficiary of an action 
  (attaches to NP or PP). BNF@-BNF benefactives <list:notation:grammatical-role:BNF>

  This tag is used  only when (1) the verb can undergo dative 
  shift and (2) the prepositional variant (with the same meaning) 
  uses for. The prepositional objects of dative-shifting verbs 
  with other prepositions than for (such as to or of) are 
  annotated -DTV. dative shift

   (S (NP-SBJ I) (VP baked (NP-BNF Doug) (NP a cake)))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ I) (VP baked (NP a cake) (PP-BNF for (NP Doug))))

  

  -DIR (direction) --- marks adverbials that answer the questions 
  “from where?” and “to where?” It implies motion, which can be 
  metaphorical as in “...rose 5 pts. to 57-1/2” or “increased 70% 
  to 5.8 billion yen” (see ). -DIR is most often used with verbs 
  of motion/transit and financial verbs: DIR@-DIR

   (S (NP-SBJ I) (VP flew (PP-DIR from (NP Tokyo)) (PP-DIR to (NP 
  New York))))

  

  -EXT (extent) --- marks adverbial phrases that describe the 
  spatial extent of an activity. -EXT was incorporated primarily 
  for cases of movement in financial space, but is also used in 
  analogous situations elsewhere. EXT@-EXT

   (S (NP-SBJ the Dow Jones Industrial Average) (VP plunged 
  (NP-EXT 190.58 points)))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ She) (VP walked (NP-EXT 5 miles)))

  

  Obligatory complements do not receive -EXT: 

   (S (NP-SBJ The sumo wrestler) (VP gained (NP 80 pounds)))

  

  Words such as fully and completely are absolutes and do not 
  receive -EXT.

  -LOC (locative) --- marks adverbials that indicate 
  place/setting of the event. LOC@-LOC locatives

   (PP-LOC on (NP the moon))

  

  -LOC may also indicate metaphorical location. For example, the 
  following receive the -LOC tag:

   (PP-LOC amongst (NP yourselves))

  

   (NP (NP a drop) (PP-LOC in domestic truck sales))

  

  

  whereas these do not:

   (NP (NP interest) (PP in anthropology))

  

   (NP (NP 5 dollars) (PP in (NP stocks)))

  

   (PP on (NP (NP grounds) (PP of ...)))

  

   (PP in (NP other respects))

  

   (PP under (NP pressure))

  

   (PP under (NP the gun))

  

  There is likely to be some variation in the use of -LOC due to 
  differing annotator interpretations. In cases where the 
  annotator is faced with choosing between -LOC or -TMP, the 
  default is -LOC: LOC@-LOC!vs. -TMP locatives TMP@-TMP!vs. -LOC

   (PP-LOC in (NP an interview))

  

   (PP-LOC in (NP active trading))

  

  In cases of apposition involving SBAR, the SBAR should not be 
  labeled -LOC.

  

  (NP (NP Minneapolis) , (SBAR (WHADVP-1 where) (S (NP-SBJ it) 
  (VP is (ADJP-PRD cold) (ADVP-LOC *T*-1))))) 

  -LOC has some uses that are not adverbial, such as with place 
  names that are adjoined to other NPs and NAC-LOC premodifiers 
  of NPs (see ). The special tag -PUT, listed on page [list:notation:grammatical-role:PUT]
  , is used for the locative argument of put. LOC@-LOC!non-adverbial uses of

  

  -MNR (manner) --- marks adverbials that indicate manner, 
  including instrument phrases. MNR@-MNR instrument phrases

   (S (NP She) (VP waited (ADVP-MNR impatiently)))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ She) (VP hit (NP the nail) (PP-MNR with (NP a 
  hammer))))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ-14 She) (VP surprised (NP him) (PP-MNR by (S-NOM 
  (NP-SBJ *-14) (VP eating (NP a horse) (ADVP-MNR alone))))))

  

  -PRP (purpose or reason) --- marks purpose or reason clauses 
  and PPs. PRP@-PRP purpose clauses reason clauses

   (S (NP-SBJ-1 Chevron) (VP had (S (NP-SBJ *-1) (VP to (VP shut 
  (PRT down) (NP (NP a crude-oil pipeline) (PP-LOC in (NP the Bay 
  area)))))) (S-PRP (NP-SBJ *-1) (VP to (VP check (PP-CLR for (NP 
  leaks)))))))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ the Dow Jones Transportation Average) (VP went 
  (ADVP-DIR down) , (PP-PRP due (ADVP largely) (PP to (NP (NP 
  further selling) (PP-LOC in (NP UAL)))))))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ-1 (NP activity) (PP-LOC at (NP (NP a number) (PP of 
  (NP (ADJP San Francisco-based) brokerage houses))))) (VP was 
  (VP curtailed (NP *-1) (PP-PRP as (NP (NP a result) (PP of (NP 
  the earthquake)))))))

  

  -TMP (temporal) --- marks temporal or aspectual adverbials that 
  answer the questions when, how often, or how long. It has some 
  uses that are not strictly adverbial, such as with dates that 
  modify other NPs (see ). TMP@-TMP

  

  at S- or VP-level:

   (S (NP-SBJ Egg bread) (VP loses (NP some zip) (SBAR-TMP 
  (WHADVP-2 when) (S (NP-SBJ the eggs) (VP come (PP-LOC-CLR in 
  (NP 30-pound cans) (ADVP-TMP *T*-2)))))))

  

   (S (ADVP-TMP Meanwhile) , (NP-SBJ (NP the bottom end) (PP of 
  (NP the market))) (VP is (VP becoming (ADJP-PRD less loyal))))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ Brand loyalty) (VP has (VP eroded (PP-TMP during 
  (NP the 1980s)))))

  

   (S (NP-SBJ-2 it) (VP will (VP remove (NP the objectionable 
  tropical oil) (PP-TMP by (NP year end)))))

  

  modifying NPs:

   (S (NP-SBJ the 26-man Politburo) (VP had (VP asked (PP-CLR for 
  (NP his resignation)) (PP-LOC at (NP (NP a separate meeting) 
  (NP-TMP late Tuesday))))))

  

   (NP (NP his (ADJP first and only) state visit) (PP to (NP 
  Bonn)) (ADVP-TMP (NP two years) ago))

  

  In cases of apposition involving SBAR, the SBAR should not be 
  labeled -TMP.  (PP-TMP in (NP (NP 1992) , (SBAR (WHADVP-4 when) 
  (S (NP-SBJ I) (ADVP-TMP first) (VP learned (SBAR 0 (S (NP-SBJ 
  I) (VP was (NP-PRD a Martian) (ADVP-TMP *T*-4))))))))) 

  in ADJP:

   (NP (NP (NP Penn Treebank Corp. 's) (ADJP 14.7  bonds) (ADJP 
  due (NP-TMP 2009)))

  

  Only in “financialspeak,” and only when the dominating PP is a 
  PP-DIR, may temporal modifiers be put at PP object level, as in 
  this example: TMP@-TMP!in ``financialspeak''

   (S (NP-SBJ unconsolidated pretax profit) (VP increased (PP-DIR 
  to (NP (QP 12.12 billion) yen)) , (PP-DIR from (NP (QP 7.12 
  billion) yen) (ADVP-TMP (NP a year) ago))))

  

  Note that -TMP is not used in possessive phrases:

   (NP (NP 1950 's) conservative tendencies)

   

1.2.4 Miscellaneous

  -CLR (closely related) CLR@-CLR --- marks constituents that 
  occupy some middle ground between argument and adjunct of the 
  verb phrase. These roughly correspond to “predication adjuncts” 
  predication adjuncts, prepositional ditransitives ditransitives!prepositional
  , and some “phrasal verbs” phrasal verbs, as defined in .

  Although constituents marked with -CLR are not strictly 
  speaking complements, they are treated as complements whenever 
  it makes a bracketing difference (see the section on fronting 
  in  and *RNR*-attach in ).

  The precise meaning of -CLR depends somewhat on the category of 
  its phrase:

  on S or SBAR --- These categories are usually arguments, so the 
    -CLR tag indicates that the clause is more adverbial than 
    normal clausal arguments. The most common case is the 
    infinitival semicomplement of use, but there are a variety of 
    other cases (see ).

  on PP, ADVP, SBAR-PRP, etc. --- On categories that are 
    ordinarily interpreted as (adjunct) adverbials, -CLR 
    indicates a somewhat closer relationship to the verb. For 
    example:

    • Prepositional Ditransitives ditransitives!prepositional

      In order to ensure consistency, the Treebank recognizes 
      only a limited class of verbs that take more than one 
      complement, as described in this section (-DTV on page [list:notation:grammatical-role:DTV]
       and -PUT on page [list:notation:grammatical-role:PUT]) and 
      in . Verbs that fall outside these classes (including most 
      of the prepositional ditransitive verbs in class [D2] in ) 
      are often annotated with -CLR:

       (VP associate (NP snow) (PP-CLR with (NP winter)))

      

       (VP donate (NP your time) (PP-CLR to (NP a good cause)))

      

    • Phrasal verbs phrasal verbs

      Phrasal verbs are also annotated with -CLR or a combination 
      of PRT and PP-CLR.

       (VP pay (PP-CLR for (NP 500 shares)))

      

       (VP adjust (PP-CLR for (NP inflation)))

      

       (VP put (PRT up) (PP-CLR with (NP the nuisance)))

      

      Words that are considered borderline between particle and 
      adverb are often bracketed with ADVP-CLR.

       (VP looking (ADVP-CLR forward) (PP-CLR to (NP their winter 
      meeting)))

      

    • Predication Adjuncts predication adjuncts

      Many of Quirk's predication adjuncts (see , especially 
      sections 8.27--35, 15.22, & 16.48) are annotated with -CLR.

       (VP place (NP the flour) (PP-LOC-CLR in (NP the sifter)))

      

       (S (NP-SBJ She) (VP sat (PP-LOC-CLR in (NP the chair))))

      

       (S (NP-SBJ He) (VP kissed (NP his mother) (PP-CLR on (NP 
      the cheek))))

      

  on NP --- To the extent that -CLR is used on noun phrases, it 
    indicates that the NP is part of some kind of “fixed phrase” 
    or expression, such as take care of.

     (VP taking (NP-CLR care) (PP-CLR of (NP the problem)))

    

     (S (NP-SBJ their meeting) (ADVP-TMP never) (VP took (NP-CLR 
    place)))

    

    Variation is more likely for NPs than for other uses of -CLR.

  -CLF (cleft) --- marks it-clefts (“true” clefts) and may be 
  added to the labels S, SINV, or SQ. See . CLF@-CLF

   (SQ-CLF Was (NP-SBJ it) (NP-PRD (NP John's) car) (SBAR (WHNP-6 
  0) (S (NP-SBJ you) (VP borrowed (NP *T*-6)))) ?)

  

  -HLN (headline) --- marks headlines and datelines. Note that 
  headlines and datelines always constitute a unit of text that 
  is structurally independent from the following sentence. HLN@-HLN
   headlines

   ( (NP-HLN (NP The end) (PP of (NP Trujillo)))) ( (S (NP-SBJ 
  (NP Assassination) (PRN , (PP (ADVP even) of (NP a tyrant)) ,)) 
  (VP is (ADJP-PRD repulsive (PP to (NP (NP men) (PP of (NP good 
  conscience)))))) .))

  

   ( (NP-HLN (NP-LOC Chicago , IL) , (NP-TMP May 8) --)) ( (S A 
  fire broke out in an abandoned building .))

  

  -TTL (title) --- is attached to the top node of a title when 
  this title appears inside running text.-TTL implies -NOM. The 
  internal structure of the title is bracketed as usual. (See  
  for more information about the bracketing of titles.) TTL@-TTL titles

   (SQ Have (NP-SBJ you) (VP read (S-TTL (NP-SBJ *) (VP To (VP 
  Kill (NP A Mockingbird))))) ?)

  

   (S “ (NP-TTL-SBJ-1 Omphalos) ” (VP was (VP painted (NP *-1) 
  (PP by (NP-LGS Mark)))))

   

1.3 Null elements

See  for more on the annotation of null elements.

 .2 ex plus .1 ex minus .1 ex 

  *T* --- trace of A^{\prime}-movement 

  (NP *) --- arbitrary PRO, controlled PRO, and trace of 
  A-movement 

  0 --- the null complementizer 

  *U* --- unit 

  *?* --- placeholder for ellipsed material 

  *NOT* --- anti-placeholder in template gapping 

The “pseudo-attach” elements (listed in section [list:notation:pseudo-attach]
) are also essentially null elements.

1.4 Coindexing

coindexing

See  for more detailed information.

1.4.1 The identity index

identity index

The number that follows a  bracket tag serves as an  identity 
index (ID number) for that constituent:(WHNP-1 What). Identity 
indices only appear when necessary, e.g., when there is a 
corresponding null element.

1.4.2 The reference index

reference index

The number that follows the null element is called its  reference 
index: (NP *T*-1). It should correspond to the identity index of 
the constituent with which the null is associated. If the null is 
not associated with a constituent in the same sentence, it does 
not receive an index.

 (S (NP-SBJ Willie) (VP knew (SBAR (WHNP-1 who) (S (NP-SBJ *T*-1) 
(VP threw (NP the ball))))))



 (SBARQ (WHNP-1 Who) (SQ was (NP-SBJ-2 *T*-1) (VP believed (S 
(NP-SBJ-3 *-2) (VP to (VP have (VP been (VP shot (NP *-3)))))))) 
?)



1.5 Pseudo-attach

pseudo-attach <list:notation:pseudo-attach>

Pseudo-attach is a method of showing that non-adjacent 
constituents are related. There are four different types of 
pseudo-attach, each of which is described in detail in . The 
pseudo attach copy bears a reference index corresponding to the 
identity index of the displaced constituent. The different types 
of pseudo-attach are:

 .2 ex plus .1 ex minus .1 ex 

  *EXP* --- Expletive (extraposition) 

  *ICH* --- Interpret Constituent Here (discontinuous dependency) 

  *PPA* --- Permanent Predictable Ambiguity (ambiguity) 

  *RNR* --- Right Node Raising (shared complements) 



1.6 Parentheticals

parentheticals PRN <list:notation:PRN>

Parenthetical elements are dominated by a node labeled PRN. 
Punctuation marks that set off a parenthetical (i.e., commas, 
dashes, parentheses (-LRB- and -RRB-)) are contained within the 
PRN node. Use of PRN is determined ultimately by individual 
annotator intuition, though the presence of dashes or parentheses 
strongly suggests a parenthetical. RRB@-RRB- LRB@-LRB- parentheses



 (S (NP-SBJ (NP Assassination) (PRN , (PP (ADVP even) of (NP a 
tyrant)) ,)) (VP is (ADJP-PRD repulsive) (PP to (NP (NP men) (PP 
of (NP good conscience))))))



 (S (NP-TMP (NP Every day) (SBAR (WHNP-1 0) (S (NP-SBJ you) (VP
