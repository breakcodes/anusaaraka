---- IDIOMS
    
    I finally figured out why this program is so slow .
    The chairs made up of wood are good .   ---->  Here  "of"  is connected with "chairs" (3rd linkage)
    Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen . --->       "of"  is connected with "is"

    Eg:-It turned out that he is a thief .
    (idiom_type_1  2 3)
    (kriyA-dummy_subject  3 1)
    (subject-subject_samAnAXikaraNa  5 8)  
    (kriyA-subject  6 5)
    (viSeRya-det_viSeRaNa  8 7)
    
     In the above sentence "turned out" is an idiom as well as LWG with "out" as head .
     i)  Here all the relations are connected with "out" where as it should be done with "turned" (relation mapping should be done.)
     ii) While loading wsd rule files if word is part of LWG other than head, will not get loaded.So, here turn.clp will never fire from WSD.

   Eg:-
    It turned out that Clinton did not actually kiss Monica .
    He gave up smoking.

   In the above two sentences, stanford parser takes both "out" and "up" as particle and the relation "prt" between "turned" and "out"  as well as between "gave" and "up",whereas Link parser takes idiomatic exp. for "turned out" and link K for "gave up" with "gave" as head word  . So to make it consistent, we have taught to take idiomatic exp. as link K, and therefore "turned" as head word in the case of "turned out". Thus the wsd rule written for a phrasal verb will work in both cases.
