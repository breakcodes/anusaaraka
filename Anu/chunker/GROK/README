   chunking Process:
   ----------------
   chunking is done in two steps. 
   
   1. POSTagger is run on the input file which creates input.POSTagger
   
   2. The output of the POSTagger (input.POSTagger file) is given to Chunker which creates input.chunker

   How to Run:
   -----------
  To run chunker ,type the following command
  
  shell>sh chunker.sh input

  This creates two files input.POSTagger and input.chunker. 

  input.chunker is the final output file.


   NOTE: To stop displaying debugging messages, remove -verbose in "chunker.sh"
