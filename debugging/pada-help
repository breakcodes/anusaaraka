What is Pada?
	A group of words that go together or forms a group in a given sentence, moving any element out of the group leads the sentence to be ungrammatical or gives some other sense or type, is called pada (phrase). For example, "Bill does not drive." In this sentence, the words does, not and drive form a pada/group. And, moving any word out of this pada will make the sentence ungrammatical or will give some different interpretation.
	*Not Bill does drive.
Moving 'not' to the sentence initial position makes sentense ungrammatical.
	Does  Bill not drive.
In this case, though the sentence remains grammatically correct but the sense and sentence type have changed.

The core assumptions taken to form padas:
	The word/s which have a single vibhakti form a pada. The vibhakti can also be zero sometimes.

1. ting vibhakti
	ting vibhaktis are verbal inflactions which make verbal padas (VP). The padas which come under this class are called tinganta padas ('wiFanwa paxa' written in WX-notation).

2. sup vibhakti
	The nominal inflactions are sup vibhaktis, make prepositional padas (PP). Padas which come under this class are called subanta padas ('subanwa paxa' written in WX-notation).

Sometimes the two padas in English become one in Hindi and vise versa. For example, Rama's book is a single pada in English but in Hindi it splits into two padas namely 'Rama's' and 'book'. Opposite to this sometimes two padas in English become one in Hindi, e.g. 'Females of birds lay eggs.', in this sentence 'Females' and 'of birds' are two different padas in English but when we come to Hindi they become one 'maadaa pakshii' (Female birds).
