<td>In this column, Link Parser relations are shown.</td><td>In this, the terms which most of the linguists use are shown.</td><td>In this corresponding Paninian relations, mapped by Sukhada are shown.</td><td>Every column has related examples shown in upper case.</td><td>Right hand side (RHS) and left hand side (LHS) of a relation name are separated with a "-" (hyphen) symbol and all the words joined with an "_" (underscore) should be treated as one word or only LHS/RHS of that relation.

<td>Ss, Sp, SX etc.</td><td>verb-subject</td><td>क्रिया-subject</td><td>The DOG CHASES the cat. There ARE FLOWERS in the garden. I must not GO to the store. ARE there FLOWERS in the garden? ARE YOU ready for next week.</td><td>अभिहित-कारक" (except dummy subject 'there') is "SUBJECT" acoording to Paninian grammar. Ex. "Ram reads" ('रामः पठति', "रामः" here "कर्ता कारक" is being अभिहित (said) by शप् [the तिङ् (तिप्)] and that is the SUBJECT.  "Ravan was killed by Ram" (रामेण रावणः अहन्यत) "रावणः" here "कर्म कारक" is being अभिहित by यक् [the तिङ् (त)] and that is the SUBJECT. So according to Paninian theory subject is similar to "अभिहित" .
