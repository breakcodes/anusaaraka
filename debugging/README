   Debugging ::
   =========

   Anusaaraka provides a debugging tool to find and reduce the bugs in the translation.

   For debugging:
   $ cd $HOME_anu_test/debugging/sentence_debug
   $ sentence_debug.sh <file_name> <sentence_number>   Ex:$ sentence_debug.sh  mytest  2.1
                                                         (Ex: for 1st sentence of 2nd paragraph of the input file "mytest")

  (NOTE : For debugging, basic knowledge of CLIPS is required.)
  

  NOTE: If you think that it is necessary to make changes/add something in the data (databases) files, then follow the following steps.
        step 1 : Go to the respective data file 
                 $HOME_anu_test/debugging/provisional_Anu_databases/<file_name>
        step 2 : Make changes/add  according to the pattern in the file.
        step 3 : compile the file using the following command:
                 sh $HOME_anu_test/debugging/provisional_Anu_databases/compile.sh 
        step 4 : Run the sentence after compiling. And, if the changes made are effective then mail the changes
                 to anusaaraka team.
        step 5 : Reset (IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESET)
                 $sh $HOME_anu_test/debugging/provisional_Anu_databases/reset.sh

  Steps to view Derived tree  ::
  =========================== 
  1. $ cd $HOME_anu_test/debugging/sentence_debug
  2. $ sh ../view_derived_tree.sh  <file_name>   Ex: $ sh ../view_derived_tree.sh  mytest  
  2. A new window opens
  3. Go to File menu -> select Open Treebank
  4. A new window opens  --> select the path upto sentence_debug (as mentioned in step 1)
                             and select derived_tree and select Open

 
  Steps to view Derivation tree  ::
  =============================
  1. $ cd $HOME_anu_test/debugging/sentence_debug
  2. $ sh ../view_derivation_tree.sh  <file_name>   Ex: $ sh ../view_derivation_tree.sh  mytest  
  3. A new window opens
  4. Go to File menu -> select Open Treebank
  5. A new window opens  --> select the path upto sentence_debug (as mentioned in step 1)
			     and select mapped_constituents and select Open


  DepTreeeViewer ::
  ==============

   $ cd $HOME_anu_test/debugging/sentence_debug
   $ sh ../DepTreeeViewer.sh <file_name> <sentence_number>   Ex: $ sh ../DepTreeeViewer.sh   mytest  2.1
  
   RUN ::
   java -jar DepTreeeViewer_17_06_10.jar

   (In "File" Menu select "Open Treebank" load option load paninian_to_conllx_format.dat  file [i.e from $HOME_anu_test/debugging/sentence_debug/paninian_to_conllx_format.dat])
