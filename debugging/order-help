1. Applying tree surgery operations(tsurgeon) on the constituents tree.

   i) Combining apostrope words with its head (where as stanford parser treats word and its apos as two different units)
      Ex:- These are children's books.

     Input :

	 (ROOT
	  (S
	    (NP (DT These))
	    (VP (VBP are)
	      (NP                                         
	        (NP (NNS children) (POS 's))
	        (NNS books)))
	    (. .)))
         
          
     Applying tsurgeon operations 

       Output :

	(ROOT
	  (S
	    (NP (DT These))
	    (VP (VBP are)
	      (NP (NP@ children) (NNS books)))
	    (. .)))


2. Removing the auxillary verbs from the tree (i.e. representing the TAM with its head in the constituent tree.) 
  
  Ex :- She is sleeping.

   (VP5 VBZ6 VP7)
   (VBZ6 is)                         ==========>  (VP5 VP7)
   (VP7 VBG8 )                                    (VP7 VBG8 )
   (VBG8 sleeping)                                (VBG8 sleeping)

3. Movement within Phrases.
   
   Ex:-  He wasted his golden opportunity to play in the national team.
                               

                                                          PP
                                                         /  \
    NP    VP             NP                 VP        IN       NP       
   [He] [wasted] [his golden opportunity] [to play] [[in][the national team]].
    1      2            3                    4             5   
                                                           |  PP = IN + NP
                                                           |
                                                           V
   [He] [wasted] [his golden opportunity] [to play] [[the national team] [in]].
    1      2            3                    4             5 

  
4. Movement across phrases.
   
    
   Ex:-  He wasted his golden opportunity to play in the national team.
                                                           
                            
    NP    VP             NP                 VP            PP
   [He] [wasted] [his golden opportunity] [to play] [in the national team].
    1 ------> 2  ---------> 3 -------------> 4 -----------> 5    

   [He] [in the national team] [to play] [his golden opportunity] [wasted]
    1 --------> 5 ----------------> 4 ---------> 3 -----------------> 2

5. Replacing the phrases with its daughters.

5. Movement within sentences. (i.e SBAR in this case)
   
   

6. Inserting new words .(Sometimes new words are inserted in the sentences for proper translation)

7. Final order.
