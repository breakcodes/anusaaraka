   to run debugging using FREEMIND :
   ===============================

1. Go to the followin directory "cd  $HOME_anu_test/debuggin/"


2. If your sentence has been run with LINK PARSER (you can see in the output) then run 
  > sh debug_link.sh <file-name> <sent-no>  
    Ex: sh  debug_link.sh test 2.1 
  > freemind debug.mm

3. If your sentence has been run with STANFORD PARSER (you can see in the output) then run 
  
  > sh debug_std.sh <file-name> <sent-no>
